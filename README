Community Shelf

This simple application serves as a great example of what you can do with merb-cache.


Notes
---------------------------

1. The namespacing on commands for db tasks has changed. If you're experimenting with community_shelf
having watched the video at http://merbcamp.com/video/burkert.mp4 you'll need to run things differently.

The dm: namespace is no longer used, so commands are now:

...
rake db:automigrate            # Perform automigration
rake db:autoupgrade            # Perform non destructive automigration
rake db:create                 # Create the database
rake db:database_yaml          # Create a sample database.yml file
...
